# Ogame_Fleet_Calc
This is just a small private calculater for desktop use.
It's not connected to any Ogame server.
The purpose of this application is to calculate the amount of ships needed in a balanced fleet.
As I'm to lazy to calculate it in my head everytime I've done a raid I developed this application to do it for me.

Example:
My fleet is to be balanced as such; for every 100 Light Fighter I will build 1o Cruisers, 5 Battleships and 2 Battlescruisers.
The app will then tell me how many cruisers I need to Re-build if I have lost, let's say, about 5k battleships.
